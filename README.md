**cookiecutter-neuroally-ai** is a comprehensive and adaptable Cookiecutter template designed to accelerate the development of AI and Machine Learning projects, with a strong emphasis on building neuro-inclusive and accessible solutions. This scaffold provides a well-structured foundation, incorporating best practices for project organization, collaboration, and deployment, particularly for projects leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and focusing on diverse cognitive needs.

## Key Features

This template offers a wide range of features that you can selectively include in your project:

* **Modular Project Structure:** A logical and organized directory layout to separate code, data, models, notebooks, documentation, and tests.
* **LLM Integration Ready:** Dedicated modules for interacting with popular LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Vertex AI, Ollama) and utilities for prompt management.
* **RAG Pipeline Support:** Includes scaffolding for building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with vector database integration.
* **UI/API Layer Options:** Easily include a user interface with Streamlit and/or a backend API with FastAPI.
* **Environment Management:** Options for Conda and/or traditional `requirements.txt` based dependency management.
* **Development Workflow:** Pre-configured for pre-commit hooks (for code formatting and linting), VS Code settings, and optional Docker and Kubernetes support.
* **CI/CD Integration:** Includes a basic GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
* **Ethical Considerations:** Optional inclusion of a Code of Conduct and a template for addressing Responsible AI practices.
* **Accessibility Focus:** Designed with considerations for building accessible AI, with potential integration points for accessibility testing.
* **Documentation & Contribution:** Includes templates for contributing guidelines and security policies.
* **Flexible Presets:** Choose from project presets like "chatbot," "rag-pipeline," "trainer," or a "minimal" setup to quickly get started.
* **Advanced Options:** Fine-grained control over including features like authentication, caching, databases, logging, monitoring, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.10 or a later version installed.
* **Cookiecutter:** Install Cookiecutter if you haven't already:
* 
    ```bash
    pip install cookiecutter
    ```

### Usage

1.  Generate a new project using the template:
2.  
    ```bash
    cookiecutter gh:your-username/cookiecutter-neuroally-ai
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username/cookiecutter-neuroally-ai` with the actual repository path if different).*

3.  Cookiecutter will prompt you to answer a series of questions to configure your project. Choose the options that best suit your needs.

4.  Once the project is generated, navigate to the project directory:
5.  
    ```bash
    cd your_project_slug
    ```

6.  Set up your development environment (either using Conda or pip based on your choice during generation).

7.  Start building your amazing neuro-inclusive AI application!
