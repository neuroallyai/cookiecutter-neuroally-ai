## üõ†Ô∏è About the Documentation Tool

*(TODO: Specify which documentation tool you plan to use, e.g., MkDocs, Sphinx, Docsify, or just plain Markdown files. You might want to include the tool's configuration file (e.g., `mkdocs.yml` or `conf.py`) in the `docs/` directory of your Cookiecutter template if `{{ cookiecutter.include_docs == 'yes' }}`.)*

For example, if using MkDocs, you might add:
"This documentation is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. To build and serve the documentation locally, ensure you have MkDocs installed (`pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material`) and run `mkdocs serve` from the project root."
