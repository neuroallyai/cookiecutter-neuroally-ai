## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
If you encounter a bug, please help us by reporting it! Before creating a bug report, please check existing issues to see if someone has already reported it.

When creating a bug report, please include:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- What you expected to happen.
- What actually happened (including any error messages or tracebacks).
- Your environment details (e.g., OS, Python version `{{ cookiecutter.python_version }}`, version of {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} `{{ cookiecutter.version }}`, browser if applicable).

### Suggesting Enhancements
We're always open to suggestions for new features or improvements to existing functionality.
- Clearly describe the enhancement and the problem it solves.
- Explain the benefits this enhancement would bring to users.
- If possible, provide examples or mockups of how it might work.

### Your First Code Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing to {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}?
- Look for issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted` in the project's issue tracker.
- You can also start by improving documentation or adding more tests.

### Pull Requests
1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-number-description`.
3.  Make your changes. Ensure you add or update tests as appropriate.
4.  Ensure your code lints and tests pass (e.g., using `make lint` and `make test` if a Makefile is provided, or by running the respective commands manually).
5.  Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message (e.g., "feat: Add X feature", "fix: Resolve Y bug").
6.  Push your branch to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
7.  Open a pull request to the `main` (or `develop`) branch of the original repository.
8.  Clearly describe your changes in the pull request. Link to any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123").

## Development Setup

To set up your development environment for {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}, please follow the instructions in the main [README.md](./README.md) under the "Getting Started" section. This will guide you through setting up {% if cookiecutter.use_conda_support == "yes" %}Conda and Poetry{% else %}Poetry{% endif %}, and installing core dependencies.

It's highly recommended to install development tools using the `dev` group defined in `pyproject.toml`:
```bash
{% if cookiecutter.use_conda_support == "yes" -%}
conda run -n {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} poetry install --with dev
{%- else -%}
poetry install --with dev
{%- endif %}
```
This will install tools like pytest for testing, and linters/formatters (e.g., Ruff, Black, Mypy) if configured in the dev group.

### Coding Standards
TODO: Define any specific coding standards or style guides here. Examples:
- "We follow PEP 8 for Python code."
- "We use Black for code formatting (run make format or poetry run black .)."
- "Docstrings should follow the Google Python Style Guide format."
- Ensure your code is well-commented where necessary to explain complex logic.
- Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages.

{% if cookiecutter.include_code_of_conduct == "yes" %}

### Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior as outlined in the Code of Conduct.
{% else %}

### Code of Conduct
We expect all contributors to interact respectfully and constructively. We value diverse perspectives and aim to create a welcoming environment for everyone.
(TODO: Consider adding a formal Code of Conduct like the Contributor Covenant if you haven't already enabled its generation.)

**Key things about this corrected template:**

* **No `project\_name`:** All instances use the correct `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}`.
* **Standard Table of Contents:** The Table of Contents links to standard Markdown headings like `#how-can-i-contribute` which are automatically generated by most Markdown renderers from `## How Can I Contribute?`. It does not include the problematic self-referential link that was causing the error.
* **Uses Cookiecutter Variables Correctly:** For project name, version, author details, etc.
* **Conditional Link to `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`:** Based on your `cookiecutter.json` flag.
* **Clear Instructions:** Provides guidance on reporting bugs, suggesting features, PRs, and development setup.
* **Placeholders (`TODO`):** Indicates where the user of the generated project should add their specific details (like coding standards).

By replacing the content of your `CONTRIBUTING.md` template with this version, the Jinja syntax error should be resolved.

After you've done this, please try running `cookiecutter` again. If a new error appears, please share it. If it succeeds, we can move on to the next file!
