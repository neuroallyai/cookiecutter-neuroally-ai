## ⭐ Overview

TODO: Provide a compelling overview of this specific project. What unique problem does it solve? What are its key features, innovations, and intended impact?

This project scaffold aims to provide a robust starting point for developing applications, with a focus on:
* *(Example: Advanced AI model integration for specific tasks)*
* *(Example: Scalable and maintainable code structure)*
* *(Example: Tools and workflows that support rapid prototyping and iteration)*

---
## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python:** Version `{{ cookiecutter.python_version }}` or higher. ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
{% if cookiecutter.use_conda_support == "yes" -%}
- **Conda (Anaconda/Miniconda):** Required for managing the Conda environment. ([Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution))
{%- else -%}
- **Poetry:** For Python package and environment management. ([Poetry Installation Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation))
{%- endif %}
- **Git:** For version control. ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- TODO: List any other essential prerequisites (e.g., specific API keys for core functionality, database access, etc.).

---
## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and get the project running.

### 1. Cloning the Repository (if applicable)
If this project is hosted on a Git platform (like GitHub), clone it to your local machine:
```bash
git clone YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE
cd {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
```

*(Replace `YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE` with the actual URL of your repository.)*

### 2. Environment Setup & Installation

This project uses {% if cookiecutter.use_conda_support == "yes" %}Conda (with Poetry for dependency management within the Conda environment){% else %}Poetry{% endif %} for environment and dependency management. The `post_gen_project.py` script included in the Cookiecutter template attempts to automate this setup when the project is first generated.

If you need to set up the environment manually or recreate it:

{% if cookiecutter.use_conda_support == "yes" -%}
**Using Conda (recommended setup):**

```bash
# 1. Create the Conda environment from the environment.yml file.
#    This file should also install Poetry within the Conda environment.
conda env create -f environment.yml

# 2. Activate the newly created Conda environment.
conda activate {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}

# 3. Install Python dependencies managed by Poetry into the active Conda environment.
#    This reads pyproject.toml and installs packages without creating a separate Poetry venv.
conda run -n {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} poetry install --no-venv
```

To activate your Conda environment in future sessions: `conda activate {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}`
{%- else -%}
**Using Poetry (default setup):**

```bash
# 1. Install project dependencies.
#    This will also create a dedicated virtual environment if one doesn't exist.
poetry install
```

To activate the virtual environment's shell: `poetry shell`
(To run commands within the Poetry environment without activating the shell: `poetry run <your_command>`)
{%- endif %}

### 3. Environment Variables (`.env`)

Securely manage API keys and other configuration settings using an `.env` file.

1.  Create your `.env` file by copying the example:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env  # For Linux/macOS/Git Bash
        # For Windows Command Prompt: copy .env.example .env
        ```
2.  Open the `.env` file and update it with your specific values (e.g., API keys, database URLs).
        **Important:** The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and should **never** be committed to version control if it contains sensitive credentials.

### 4. Installing Optional Dependencies

For projects with extended functionalities, a `requirements_full.txt` might list all optional dependencies. To install them:
{% if cookiecutter.use_conda_support == "yes" -%}

```bash
conda run -n {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} pip install -r requirements_full.txt
```

{%- else -%}

```bash
poetry run pip install -r requirements_full.txt
```

{%- endif %}
*(Note: Ensure `requirements_full.txt` is generated or maintained appropriately for your project if you use this feature.)*

## 📁 Project Organization

This project follows a standard "src-layout" structure:

```
{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/
├── .env.example           # Example environment variables
├── .gitattributes         # Git attributes for consistent handling of files
├── .gitignore             # Files and directories ignored by Git
├── data/                  # Data files for the project
│   └── raw/               # Original, immutable data
│       └── .gitkeep       # Ensures 'raw' directory is versioned
├── docs/                  # Project documentation files
│   └── index.md           # Main documentation page (example)
├── notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
│   └── example.ipynb      # Example notebook
├── src/                   # Source code directory
│   └── {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/  # The main Python package
│       ├── __init__.py    # Initializes the package, defines public API
│       └── main.py        # Example: Main application logic or entry point
├── tests/                 # Automated tests for the project
│   ├── __init__.py        # Makes 'tests' a Python package
│   └── test_example.py    # Example test file
├── environment.yml        # Conda environment specification (if using Conda)
├── LICENSE                # Project's license information
├── pyproject.toml         # Project metadata and Python dependencies (for Poetry)
├── README.md              # This file: Overview and guide
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies (can be exported from Poetry for specific needs)
└── requirements_full.txt  # Optional: Comprehensive list of all dependencies including extras
```

The primary source of truth for Python dependencies is `pyproject.toml` when using Poetry.

-----

## 🙈 Adjusting `.gitignore`

The provided `.gitignore` file is a good starting point. However, always review and customize it for your project's specific needs. For example, the handling of the `/data/` directory:

```plaintext
# In .gitignore, you might have:
# /data/
```

This line would exclude the `data` directory from source control. If your data is small, non-sensitive, or managed with Git LFS, you might remove this line. Otherwise, ensure sensitive data or large files are appropriately excluded.

-----

## 🛠️ Usage

TODO: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to run your project and use its main features.
Include command-line examples, API usage if it's a library, or steps to launch a web application.

```python
# Placeholder for a Python usage example:
# from {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} import main
#
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     print(f"Running {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}!")
#     # Call your main function or demonstrate a key feature
#     # main.execute_core_functionality()
```

{% if cookiecutter.include_tests == "yes" -%}

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
{% if cookiecutter.use_conda_support == "yes" -%}
conda run -n {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} pytest
{%- else -%}
poetry run pytest
{%- endif %}
```
