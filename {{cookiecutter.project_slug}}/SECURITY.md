# Security Policy for {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

The {{ cookiecutter.author_name }} team and community take the security of the {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} software seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}, please report it to us privately as quickly as possible. **Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email the details of your findings to:
**{{ cookiecutter.author_email }}** {# TODO: For larger or more mature projects, consider setting up a dedicated security email address like security@yourprojectdomain.com or using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting features if enabled. #}

Please include the following details in your report:

* A clear description of the vulnerability, including the affected component or feature.
* The steps required to reproduce the vulnerability.
* The potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., data exposure, denial of service).
* Any PoC (Proof of Concept) code, screenshots, or network traces that help demonstrate the vulnerability.
* Your name or alias for acknowledgment (if desired).

## Our Commitment

If you report a vulnerability, we commit to:

* Acknowledging receipt of your vulnerability report in a timely manner (e.g., within 2-3 business days).
* Providing you with an estimated timeframe for addressing the vulnerability.
* Notifying you when the vulnerability has been fixed.
* Publicly acknowledging your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

We aim to investigate and address reported vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. The exact timeline will depend on the complexity and severity of the issue.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the latest stable release of {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}. If you are using an older version, please consider upgrading to the latest version, as vulnerabilities may have already been addressed.

*(TODO: As your project matures, you might want to define specific supported versions or branches here.)*

## Security Practices & Considerations

While this is a project scaffold, users building upon it should consider the following security best practices:

* **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies (`poetry update` or as per your Conda workflow) to incorporate security patches from upstream libraries. Use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
* **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize any user-supplied input or data from external sources to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, command injection, etc.).
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms if your application handles user accounts or protected resources.
* **Secrets Management:** Never hardcode secrets (API keys, passwords, database credentials). Use environment variables (managed via `.env` files, which should be in `.gitignore`) or a dedicated secrets management solution.
* **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages.
* **Rate Limiting & Resource Management:** Protect against denial-of-service attacks by implementing rate limiting (e.g., using `fastapi-limiter` if FastAPI is included) and managing resource usage.
* **Secure Defaults:** Aim for secure defaults in your application's configuration.
* **Regular Security Audits:** For critical applications, consider periodic security audits or penetration testing.

*(TODO: Remove or adapt the "Security Practices & Considerations" section above to be more specific to the actual functionalities and risks of projects typically built with this scaffold, or leave it as general advice for the user of the generated project.)*

## Out of Scope Vulnerabilities

* Vulnerabilities in third-party services or dependencies (please report those to the respective vendors).
* Social engineering attacks.
* Denial of service attacks on public infrastructure unless it's due to a specific flaw in {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}.
* Reports of outdated software versions without a demonstration of a specific vulnerability.

We appreciate your help in keeping {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} secure!
Key aspects of this SECURITY.md template:

Conditional Generation: The file is created only if {{ cookiecutter.include_security == 'yes' }}.
Clear Reporting Channel: Provides a direct email ({{ cookiecutter.author_email }}) for reporting vulnerabilities privately. Includes a TODO to consider a dedicated security address for more mature projects.
Responsible Disclosure Encouraged: Emphasizes not using public issue trackers for security issues.
Process Outline: Sets expectations for what reporters can expect (acknowledgment, timeframe).
Scope (Basic): Mentions focusing on the latest stable release.
Security Best Practices Advice: Provides a section with general security advice relevant to developers using the scaffold. This is particularly useful for a template, as it educates the user of the generated project.
Out of Scope: Helps manage expectations for what types of reports are relevant.
Action for you:

Create the conditional file in your template: cookiecutter-neuroally-ai/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/{% if cookiecutter.include_security == 'yes' %}SECURITY.md{% endif %}
Paste the content above into this file.
Review the TODO comments and decide if you want to adjust the default contact email or the "Security Practices" section for your template's typical use case.
