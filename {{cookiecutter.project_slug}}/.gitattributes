# Jupyter Notebooks:
# Notebooks are JSON but can have large diffs due to output and metadata.
# Option 1: Treat as binary for diffing (simple, avoids noisy diffs in basic git diff)
# *.ipynb -diff
# Option 2: Specify a custom diff driver (requires user setup, e.g., with nbdime)
# *.ipynb diff=jupyter
# For a template, simply ensuring they are treated as text with LF endings is a good start,
# and users can configure custom diff tools if they wish.
# The *.json rule above might cover .ipynb if not explicitly listed.
# Let's be explicit:
*.ipynb text eol=lf
# If you use nbdime or similar tools, you might add:
# *.ipynb diff=ipynb
