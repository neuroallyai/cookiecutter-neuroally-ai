## ⭐ Overview

TODO: Provide a compelling overview of this specific project. What unique problem does it solve? What are its key features, innovations, and intended impact?

This project scaffold aims to provide a robust starting point for developing applications, with a focus on:
* *(Example: Advanced AI model integration for specific tasks)*
* *(Example: Scalable and maintainable code structure)*
* *(Example: Tools and workflows that support rapid prototyping and iteration)*

---
## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python:** Version `3.10` or higher. ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Poetry:** For Python package and environment management. ([Poetry Installation Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation))
- **Git:** For version control. ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- TODO: List any other essential prerequisites (e.g., specific API keys for core functionality, database access, etc.).

---
## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and get the project running.

### 1. Cloning the Repository (if applicable)
If this project is hosted on a Git platform (like GitHub), clone it to your local machine:
```bash
git clone YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE
cd neuroally_ai
```
(Replace YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE with the actual URL of your repository.)

### 2. Environment Setup & Core Installation

This project uses Poetry for environment and dependency management. The `post_gen_project.py` script (part of the Cookiecutter template) attempts to automate this initial setup when the project is first generated. This step installs core dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`.

If you need to set up the environment manually or recreate it:

**Using Poetry:**
```bash
# 1. Install core project dependencies and create/use a virtual environment.
poetry install
```
To activate the Poetry virtual environment's shell: `poetry shell`  
(To run commands within the Poetry environment without activating the shell: `poetry run <your_command>`)

### 3. Environment Variables (.env)

Securely manage API keys and other configuration settings using an `.env` file.

Create your `.env` file by copying the example:
```bash
cp .env.example .env  # For Linux/macOS/Git Bash
# For Windows Command Prompt: copy .env.example .env
```
Open the `.env` file and update it with your specific values (e.g., API keys, database URLs).  
**Important:** The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and should **never** be committed to version control if it contains sensitive credentials.

### 4. Installing Optional Features

This project uses Poetry's dependency groups to manage optional features. Based on the choices you made during project generation (`enable_advanced_options = yes`), you can install additional capabilities. All optional dependencies are defined in `pyproject.toml`.


To install selected optional features:


**Testing Utilities (pytest, etc.):**
```bash
poetry install --with dev
```


**Jupyter Notebooks Support (JupyterLab):**
```bash
poetry install --with notebooks
```


**FastAPI Web Framework:**
```bash
poetry install --with fastapi
```
(This group includes fastapi-limiter as configured in pyproject.toml if you selected caching features alongside FastAPI).


**Streamlit UI Framework:**
```bash
poetry install --with streamlit
```


**LangChain & Vector DB Clients:**
```bash
poetry install --with langchain
```


**OpenAI API Client:**
```bash
poetry install --with openai
```


**Ollama Client:**
```bash
poetry install --with ollama
```


**Google Gemini API Client:**
```bash
poetry install --with gemini
```


**Google Vertex AI Client:**
```bash
poetry install --with vertex
```


**Database Tools (SQLAlchemy, psycopg2):**
```bash
poetry install --with db
```


**Redis Client:**
```bash
poetry install --with redis
```


**Docker Python Client (for interacting with Docker API):**
```bash
poetry install --with dockerpy
```


**Kubernetes Python Client:**
```bash
poetry install --with kubernetespy
```


**n8n Client:**
```bash
poetry install --with n8nclient
```


**Application Logging Tools (Structlog):**
```bash
poetry install --with app_logging
```


**Application Monitoring Tools (Prometheus Client):**
```bash
poetry install --with app_monitoring
```


**Responsible AI Tools (e.g., Pydantic-i18n):**
```bash
poetry install --with responsible_ai_tools
```


**Data Validation Tools (e.g., Voluptuous):**
```bash
poetry install --with data_validation_tools
```


**CLI Tools (e.g., Typer/Click dependencies):**
```bash
poetry install --with cli_tools
```


**Documentation Generator Tools (e.g., MkDocs/Sphinx dependencies):**
```bash
poetry install --with docs_tools
```


You can install multiple groups at once, e.g.:
```bash
poetry install --with dev fastapi langchain
```
(Adjust for Conda with `conda run -n neuroally_ai ...`)

If you wish to install all optional dependencies from all defined groups, you can use:
```bash
poetry install --all-extras
```
(Note: `--all-extras` installs all dependencies from all optional groups. This is equivalent to listing all groups with `--with`.)

## 📁 Project Organization

This project follows a standard "src-layout" structure:

```
neuroally_ai/
├── .env.example           # Example environment variables
├── .gitattributes         # Git attributes for consistent handling of files
├── .gitignore             # Files and directories ignored by Git
├── data/                  # Data files for the project
│   └── raw/               # Original, immutable data
│       └── .gitkeep       # Ensures 'raw' directory is versioned
├── docs/                  # Project documentation files
│   └── index.md           # Main documentation page (example)
├── notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
│   └── example.ipynb      # Example notebook
├── src/                   # Source code directory
│   └── neuroally_ai/  # The main Python package
│       ├── __init__.py    # Initializes the package, defines public API
│       └── main.py        # Example: Main application logic or entry point
├── tests/                 # Automated tests for the project
│   ├── __init__.py        # Makes 'tests' a Python package
│   └── test_example.py    # Example test file
├── environment.yml        # Conda environment specification (if using Conda)
├── LICENSE                # Project's license information
├── pyproject.toml         # Project metadata and Python dependencies (for Poetry) - THIS IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH
├── README.md              # This file: Overview and guide
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies (can be exported from Poetry for specific needs, see comments within)
└── requirements_full.txt  # Optional: Can be generated from Poetry to list all possible dependencies
```

The primary source of truth for Python dependencies is `pyproject.toml` when using Poetry.  
The `requirements.txt` file is secondary and can be generated from `pyproject.toml` using `poetry export ...` as described in its comments.

---

## 🙈 Adjusting .gitignore

The provided `.gitignore` file is a good starting point. However, always review and customize it for your project's specific needs. For example, the handling of the `/data/` directory:

```plaintext
# In .gitignore, you might have:
# /data/
```

This line would exclude the `data` directory from source control. If your data is small, non-sensitive, or managed with Git LFS, you might remove this line. Otherwise, ensure sensitive data or large files are appropriately excluded.

---

## 🛠️ Usage

TODO: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to run your project and use its main features.  
Include command-line examples, API usage if it's a library, or steps to launch a web application.

```python
# Placeholder for a Python usage example:
# from neuroally_ai import main
#
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     print(f"Running NeuroAlly AI!")
#     # Call your main function or demonstrate a key feature
#     # main.execute_core_functionality()
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

This project uses `pytest` for automated testing. To run the test suite (ensure you've installed the dev group dependencies):

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
TODO: Add more details if you have specific test configurations, coverage targets, or different types of tests (unit, integration, etc.).
